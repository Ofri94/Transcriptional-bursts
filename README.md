# Transcriptional-bursts
Scripts for the Gillespie simulations of our transcriptional bursts model

stochastic_transcription_cooperative_new runs simulations for regular sites (CSL)
stochastic_cooperativity_analysis_new runs simulations for cooperative sites (SPS)
stochastic_transcription_dominant_repressor_new runs simulations for regular sites (CSL) with the addition of a dominant repressor
stochastic_transcription_nondominant_repressor_new runs simulations for regular sites (CSL) with the addition of a non-dominant repressor
momean_time is a temporaly-based moving average function

A is the activator's concentration, R is the repressor concentration
N is total number of sites (always set to 6 in the paper)
Cis the cooperativity factor (set to 20 in the simulations)
